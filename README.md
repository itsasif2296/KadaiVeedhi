Website on viewing nearby local subsidairy stores

Hi, I'm Mohammed Asif,i thought of pursuing my computer prog journey once again so this is one of the project i worked with two other members based on the Google Maps API. 

Main technology used for this project are as follows :- 
Php - HTML + CSS
A Google maps API key for the use of Google maps within the website
SQL for saving the latitude and longitude of the store and furthermore add the details about the store category , items etc.
